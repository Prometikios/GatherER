It is a scirpt that I coded (abviously got help from google) which basically makes a **total ingredients** list 4 u.

What does it do?:
    Gets your dinner names and searchs in a cooking website.
    Combines each dinner ingredients into a one list and exports it as a txt file.
    [IF u like] adds italian translations to your list.
    [Depends on your wish] sends u...
    [And if u like] it cleans the non-needed files anymore for u those The script made to work on them.

How to use it:
    Download the python files [NOT NonUsed dir!]
    run Scuderio.py & see the magic happining
